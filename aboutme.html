								<img src="images/cu_boulder.jpg" alt="CU Boulder Campus View" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" width="400" height="250"> 
								I was born and raised in Colorado and went to the University of Colorado at Boulder where I graduated with a B.S.in Computer Science and a Minor in Business. While in college, I fell in love with the world of data and databases thanks to the Database Systems course. I really liked the idea of being able to organize and structure data in different ways and have the ability to use queries to perform analysis.

								<img src="images/cuchange_lab_logo.avif" alt="CU Change Lab logo" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;" width="250" height="250"> 
								This then led me to my part time job as a Data Management Team member with CU Change Lab where I organized and sorted data collected from various researchers' projects, presenting it in a more user-friendly format. 
								I also refined and improved existing Python ETL code to align with the specific needs and requirements of each research group. Furthermore, I effectively updated and queried data within both MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. 
								To facilitate data visualization and management, I developed dedicated websites for each project, enabling researchers to easily view, organize, and access their data and associated files. 
								Finally, I employed wireframing techniques to present prototype websites to different project groups, fostering collaborative discussions and identifying areas for improvement in the user interface and overall functionality.

								After college I accepted the offer to be a Rotational Production Business Technology Analyst at Pennymac. 
								For the first six months I was a part of the Master Data Management team. As an analyst on the team, I provided crucial support to developers by leveraging my expertise in data analysis tools such as Snowflake, Reltio, and Salesforce. This involved meticulously identifying specific data populations through targeted queries, uncovering patterns within data discrepancies that often signaled underlying system or process issues. 
								Furthermore, I effectively translated complex developer requirements and encountered issues into concise and actionable stories or tasks, facilitating seamless collaboration and efficient project execution. I also actively collaborated with fellow analysts to optimize workflows and ensure the timely and successful completion of all assigned projects and tasks.

								<img src="images/cdl logo.png" alt="CDL Icon" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;" width="250" height="250"> 
								In the last three months of the program I was a part of the Consumer Direct Lending Fulfillment team. As a key member of the project team, I excelled at translating complex business requirements into clear and concise acceptance criteria, ensuring a shared understanding and successful project delivery. 
								I proactively analyzed the impact of stakeholder enhancements, identifying and mitigating potential conflicts early in the development process. Furthermore, I maintained open and effective communication with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, clarifying enhancement requests and ensuring alignment with project objectives. 
								To guarantee the quality and reliability of new functionalities, I conducted thorough testing and meticulously documented all processes for future reference and maintainability.

								<img src="images/pennymac_logo.jpeg" alt="Pennymac Logo" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;" width="250" height="250"> 
								Upon completing the rotational program, I became an Associate Product Analyst, contributing to the development of a new Loan Origination System by focusing on the Document Generation aspect of the project. 
								To significantly enhance the disclosure process, I spearheaded initiatives to improve efficiency, accuracy, and client satisfaction. This involved centralizing documentation, progress tracking, and vendor collaboration through the implementation of robust systems. 
								By incorporating rigorous verification steps and aligning systems for accurate disclosures, I ensured strict adherence to regulatory compliance and data integrity, effectively mitigating legal and financial risks. 
								To guarantee a seamless and user-friendly experience, I rigorously tested and verified the functionality of critical features, including document removal, one-time consent, and privacy policy forms. 
								Furthermore, I formalized workflows to optimize communication, collaboration, and operational efficiency while preparing systems for future data input and reporting. To foster transparency, accountability, and progress monitoring across teams, I maintained a centralized knowledge repository. 
								Leveraging Google Apps Script, I developed automated solutions that streamlined documentation management by eliminating repetitive tasks and reducing manual effort, thereby enhancing efficiency and consistency across the entire disclosure process.

								<img src="images/traveling-world.webp" alt="Travel Icon" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px;" width="250" height="250"> 
								Outside of work, I'm a homebody who loves to relax with my cat, Bon Bon, and binge-watch anime, kdramas, or cdramas. I'm also a passionate foodie, always eager to discover new restaurants, especially when I can share the experience with friends. 
								As a board game enthusiast, Catan is my absolute favorite, and I enjoy weekly game nights with my crew. 
								I'm also rekindling my love for the clarinet, hoping to eventually join a community band. 
								Ultimately, I dream of traveling the world, immersing myself in different cultures, savoring unique cuisines, and experiencing all that life has to offer.
